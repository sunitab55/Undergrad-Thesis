The classical hook-length formula from the 1950s, counting the
number of standard young tableaux of straight shapes is one of the beautiful
results in Enumerative Combinatorics. Unlike the straight shapes, there isn't
an elegant product formula for skew shapes yet. Okounkov and Olshanski
found a positive formula for enumerating the standard young tableaux of skew
shapes in 1996. Only recently in 2014, Naruse introduced another formula to
count the number of standard young tableaux of skew shapes as a positive sum
over excited diagrams of products of hook-lengths. We study these formulas
and hope to gain more insight into the graph representations and observed
bijections with Young's Lattice.
